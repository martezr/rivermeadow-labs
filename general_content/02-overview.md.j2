# Solution Overview
---
The RiverMeadow platform is a workload mobility solution that enables organizations to migrate, optimize, and modernize workloads (physical servers and virtual machines) from any source to over a dozen target clouds and hypervisors.

## Platform Features
**Operating System (OS) Hardening**

Harden Windows Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) systems using CIS benchmarks.

**OS Modernization** 

Upgrade Windows and Linux systems to 

**SQL Modernization**

Upgrade Microsoft SQL Server databases using

**Linux OS Conversion**

Convert Linux workloads from one Linux distribution to another (Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, Amazon Linux, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux) to enable OS standardization

**Storage Rightsizing**

Adjust the allocated storage for workloads during the migration to reduce excess or wasted allocated storage.

**Migration Extensions**

Execute Bash or PowerShell scripts to perform post-migration tasks such as software removal, software installation, application reconfiguration and more.

## Migration Targets
The RiverMeadow platform enables the migration of physical, virtual or cloud workloads to the following 
{% if cloud_code == "aws" %}
* AWS EC2
* AWS Outposts Racks
* Red Hat OpenShift on AWS (ROSA)
* Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2) on AWS
* VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC on AWS)
{% endif %}

{% if cloud_code == "vme" %}
* HPE Morpheus VM Essentials Software
* HPE Morpheus Enterprise Software
{% endif %}

{% if cloud_code == "vme" %}
* HPE Morpheus VM Essentials Software
* HPE Morpheus Enterprise Software
{% endif %}

## Migration Methods
The RiverMeadow platform supports the migration of workloads using OS (agent) and VM (agentless) based migrations.
The different migration types support different features, the following table details the features that are supported by each migration type:

| Feature | Description | VM Based (Agentless) | OS Based (Agent) |
|---------|--|-----|-----------|
| **Supported Sources** | Where the source systems can be migrated from | VMware vSphere | Any (physical or virtual)|
| **Supported Operating Systems** | The supported operating systems for the source systems | Any Supported OS | Windows and Linux (x86 and ARM) |
| **Supported Targets** | The targets supported by the migration method | Any Supported | Any Supported|
| **Retain source IP and MAC addresses** | | Yes | No |
| **Compute Righsizing** | | Yes | Yes (No recommendations) |
| **Storage Rightsizing** | | No | Yes |
| **Migration Extensions** | Execute post-migration scripts using Bash or PowerShell  |  No | Yes |
| **OS Modernization** | Automated OS upgrades for Windows and Linux systems | No | Yes |
| **SQL Modernization** | Automated upgrades for Microsoft SQL Server | No | Yes |
| **OS Hardening** | Harden Windows Server and RHEL systems using CIS Benchmarks | No | Yes |
| **OS Conversion** | Convert between Linux distributions that are derivaties of the same based operating system  |  No | Yes |

### Storage Optimization

Reduce cloud operating costs with recuced

#### Key Benefits

The following are key benefits of the operating system modernization feature:

* **Reduced Cloud Costs:** The clone based methodology reduces the risk associated with in-place upgrades that rely on snapshots and commonly require an extended period of downtime simply for testing the upgrade.
* **Optimized Storage Space:**

**Storage Optimization Examples**

The following are examples of storage optimization that can be completed utilizing the storage rightsizing feature:

  <summary>**Windows Server 2019 VM with a 2 TB data drive**</summary>

  This is the detailed content

  Allocated Storage = 2,000 GB
  Used Storage = 600 GB
  Price per GB = .08
  2,000 GB x .08 = $160 USD per month

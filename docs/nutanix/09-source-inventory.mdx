# Adding source servers
---
Source servers are added to the RiverMeadow platform's source inventory using the UI, REST API, a CSV or the VMware vSphere integration.

Adding source workloads to the RiverMeadow inventory can be done using the following methods:

* **RiverMeadow UI:** Source workloads for OS based migrations (agent) can be added one at a time using the RiverMeadow user interface.
* **CSV Upload:** Source workloads for OS based migrations (agent) can be added in bulk by uploading a CSV file via the RiverMeadow user interface.
* **REST API:** Source workloads for OS based migrations (agent) can be added in bulk in a programattic fashion using the RiverMeadow REST API.
* **VMware vSphere:** Source workloads for VM based migrations (agentless) can be added in bulk via the RiverMeadow integration with VMware vSphere to query the vSphere virtual machines using the vSphere REST API.

* **Username (Optional):** The username of the user account used to automate the installation of the RiverMeadow agent on the source machine.
* **Password (Optional):** The password of the user account used to automate the installation of the RiverMeadow agent on the source machine.
